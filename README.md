# MKDD RNG Bruteforcing TAS Tool

In MKDD you control two drivers, who each can draw items from their respective RNG tables. Sometimes, you want to be able to predict which items are available to you in the near future,
or you may want to figure out if and when a specific combination of item-draws is at all possible. This tool allows you to do exactly that:

- accurately predict upcomming item draws, depending on position and other factors
- find an RNG sequence for a specified sequence of item-rolls by bruteforcing (over all 4 billion possibilities if neccessary)
 
Simply select the two drivers that you are playing in-game, check off some gamestate flags, input your current RNG seed into the program or fill in an XML file that is fed into the program in order to get your results.
